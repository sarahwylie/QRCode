## My process

After carefully reviewing the image, and moved the style-guide properties into place and laid out the simple HTML. Once that was complete, I played with the CSS until the product appeared to match the guidelines. I like to add a touch of fun, so I put some pops in there that would still comply to the guidelines. All of this was accomplished in roughly one hour.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I'm the type of person who likes to reference my existing work, even for simple code, and that's OK!

### Continued development

I'm not always comfortable with mobile and screen-size responsiveness. This takes a lot for me to admit because I pride myself on making accessible sites. I'm always striving to learn and grow!
